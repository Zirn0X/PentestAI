# Front-End Project

This repository contains the front-end code for the project. It is structured to include different components, pages, utilities, and configuration files necessary for building and running the application.

### Key Files

- **src/assets/icons/**: Contains static assets.

- **src/components/utils/**: Utility functions and helpers that are used throughout the app. Reusable components such as buttons, inputs, etc.

- **src/pages/**: Contains different page-level components, such as `Home.tsx`.

- **App.tsx**: Main component that initializes the app.
- **eslint.config.mjs**: ESLint configuration file to maintain code quality.

- **.prettierrc**: Configuration file for Prettier to ensure code formatting consistency.

- **package.json**: Contains project metadata and scripts to run various tasks such as formatting, linting, and building the project.

## Development Workflow

### Prettier and ESLint

Before pushing any changes, it's required to ensure that the code is properly formatted and follows the defined coding standards. Prettier and ESLint are used for this purpose.

- **Prettier**: Ensures consistent code formatting across the project.
- **ESLint**: Analyzes the code for potential errors and enforces coding standards.

### Commands

To check your code before pushing, use the following commands:

- **Format code with Prettier**:
  ```bash
  npm run format

- **Lint code with ESLint:**:
  ```bash
  npm run lint

Both of these commands must pass without errors before you can push your changes.

### Additional Notes

- If there are any issues reported by Prettier or ESLint, fix them before attempting to push your code.

- The `.prettierignore` file can be used to specify files or directories that should not be formatted by Prettier.

- The `.prettierrc` and `eslint.config.mjs` files contain configuration settings for Prettier and ESLint, respectively.
